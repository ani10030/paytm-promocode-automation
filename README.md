# paytm-promocode-automation
Automatic PayTM transactions with Promo codes using Python and Selenium

This script uses selenium browser automation with Python 2.7. Once you run this script, you will need to manually login to your PayTM account once. Also, you will need to enter the number of times you want to repeat a transaction.

For example, if you enter 5, the program will perform 5 transactions from your PayTM balance. Amount and Promo codes are hard-coded in the script and can be easily modified as per requirement.
